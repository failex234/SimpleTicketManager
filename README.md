# SimpleTicketManager
This is a little project I have been working on in the beginning
of my wonderful java programming journey.

Yes I know! It's not beautiful nor is it in any way programmed appropiatly but remember, these were my first days!

#Commands
- /ticket compose \<message> - Composes a new ticket. Only composes if your last composed ticket got reviewed.
- /ticket status - Tells the player if their ticket got reviewed or not.
- /ticket list - Lists all non-reviewed tickets
- /ticket review \<playername|UUID> - Reviews the ticket of that player with that name/UUID.
- /ticket stats | /ticket stats \<name|UUID> - Shows your ticket stats or ticket stats from that name/UUID.

#Features
- Tickets get saved in the MySQL database.
- Ingame review of tickets.
- Multi-server support. You just need to install this plugin on the other servers in your Bungee Network.
- Ticket stats from players.
- You'll probably find better plugin x)
